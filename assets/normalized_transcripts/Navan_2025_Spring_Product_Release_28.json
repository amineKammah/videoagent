  "full_text": "Welcome to Navan's Spring 2025 release. I'm Rich Liu, CEO of Travel at Navan and I'm thrilled to share some of our most exciting new features. We've made functionality more functional and personalization more personal. For you, that means more control over travel and expense management and a stronger T&E program. Ready? Let's go. First up, flight bookings. Our teams have been heads down responding to all the complex behind the scenes changes happening with content distribution. We're optimizing our flight storefront so that when your travelers shop for flights, they can quickly scan the details and make faster decisions. And NDC, we've become the industry leader because we've seen the savings and efficiencies it offers. So we continue to go big on NDC with 18 live connections, now including Iberia, Breeze, and Aegean Airlines coming soon. Next up, let's talk data. Travel data can be unhelpful without a clear way of understanding the story it's telling. That's why very soon we're expanding our analytics capabilities to offer clearer, more actionable insights. Interactive dashboards and widgets will surface trends, identify savings opportunities, examine traveler behavior, and let you set real-time alerts. No data science degree required. Next up, mobile bookings, which were completely redesigned for flights and hotels on iOS. This intuitive new interface guides travelers seamlessly from search to checkout with easier comparisons along the way. And because it's just as important to manage expenses on the go, we've redesigned our iOS and Android expense experience for easier navigation. At Navan, we've always been innovative and now we're officially integrated with Uber for Business. All that receipt searching and submitting after an Uber ride? Gone. Now Navan automatically matches Uber receipts to transactions and uploads them right after you ride. It's another example of how we're driving the conversation. And speaking of driving, we've improved our mileage tracker with more precise distance calculations and rates more closely aligned with regional regulations. Logging distances is a breeze and Navan's automatic reclaim calculations mean employees can get reimbursed faster than ever. We're also helping accountants increase their efficiency and the accuracy of the data they need. Our updated accounting review page better supports accrual-based accounting by syncing reimbursements into your ERP based on the transaction date. We've also added new filters and direct ERP syncing for more customized control and better cash flow visibility. Plus, we've made month-end close speedier with bulk actions. Now you can edit and apply up to 50 changes at once. What's next for Navan? Follow us on LinkedIn and check us out at navan.com to learn more.",
