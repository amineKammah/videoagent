  "full_text": "Hi, my name is Doug, I'm an account manager here at Navan. And today we're going to run through making a multi-city flight booking using the Navan web app. To begin with, we're going to start at the homepage as we usually would and search flights in the same way as we usually would. However, the only difference is we're going to change the toggle from round-trip to multi-city and we have the option here to add multiple legs when we're traveling. In this example, we're going to be going from London to Madrid to Barcelona and back to London again. You'll see as we build up this itinerary, we're choosing our departure dates, the arrival and departure airports, and then we're able to add more flights if needs be. When we search for these flights, the dynamic policy works in the same way how it usually would when selecting a one-way or a round-trip flight. And you'll see when the options come through, they'll be either bundled or be able to be booked as one leg at a time. If you do have any bookings where there's more than two or three different cities you're traveling to, our suggestion is to always go through our travel support team where you can. As mentioned, when the prices have come through, you'll see we have the bundled options and the custom flights options. When we click into the custom flights, we select each leg at a time as if it was a one-way trip. From here, if you select the bundle, you can go through to check out and you're ready to fly.",
